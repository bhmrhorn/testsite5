## AP CS Principles Performance Task

There is no restriction on the amount of preparation a student may undergo before beginning the AP CS Principles Create Performance Task. I am happy to provide preparation for students who will later complete the AP CSP Create Performance Task. I can also provide assistance with practice Performance Tasks that are not intended to be submitted to the College Board. The College Board limits collaboration on a Performance Task that will be submitted for scoring as part of a student's AP Exam grade. I cannot provide assistance with Performance Tasks that will be submitted to the College Board.

## Experience working with girls in AP Computer Science

[Why is this important?](/wp/ap-computer-science-tutor/tutoring-girls-in-ap-computer-science/)

## Qualifications

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I'm a New Jersey certified teacher at Wayne Hills High School.

I was a 2016 AP Standards Setting Committee Member. The [Standards Setting Committee](https://aphighered.collegeboard.org/exams/scoring) recommends cut scores for each of the 1-5 AP Exam scores.

When I worked at West Windsor Plainsboro High School South, teams from my classes won the 2007 and 2010 NJIT High School Programming Contests. My students wrote unique and challenging projects using Eclipse, BlueJ, and the command line.

In 2011 &amp; 2012, I was selected as an instructor for Google's CAPE Program. Together with other top CS educators from around the country, I taught animation, robotics, mobile programming, and other skills to aspiring high school freshmen. Local TV station NY1 featured the New York City CAPE Site at which I taught.

My services offer substantial advantages over tutoring by college students, professors, programmers, and online tutoring conglomerates. I tutor only one subject for which I am extensively qualified. I work with only one student at a time unless a group session has been arranged. My students complete all assignments themselves and develop an understanding of the underlying concepts.

## How Online AP Computer Science Tutoring Works

Online AP Computer Science isn't just more convenient than in person tutoring, it's also effective. You can work in the environment in which you're most comfortable. Whether you prefer a 3 monitor setup in your bedroom or a MacBook in your backyard, you aren't limited to a messy kitchen table.

1. Share screens with Google Meet (no camera needed).
2. Talk using your computer microphone or a regular phone.

I'm available as an online AP Computer Science tutor anywhere in the world. I've worked with students in nearby locations including Princeton, West Windsor, Plainsboro and South Brunswick New Jersey. I'm also comfortable working with students from different time zones including Texas, California, London, Germany and Singapore.

I do not privately tutor my own students. Students currently enrolled in my classes who are seeking help should schedule time with me during their study hall periods, during lunch or in the morning.
