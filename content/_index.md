# AP Computer Science Tutoring

I offer private online AP Computer Science tutoring via Google Meet.

I teach computer science at a top NJ high school. In 2011 and 2012 I taught computer science at Google’s CAPE Program. Students I tutor receive access to materials such as AP Computer Science practice exams, assignments and projects. Homework help and exam prep are available.

Some of my exam practice materials are featured at my [AP Computer Science Review](http://apcomputersciencetutoring.com/) site.

[Contact me](/wp/contact/) with questions or to schedule tutoring.
